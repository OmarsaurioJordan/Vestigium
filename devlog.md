- reading of documentation and review of multimedia material about design.
- testing of 3rd project version, to analize UX.
- fast reading of code to understand the project and plan improvements.
- paper sketchs to re-plan software structures and gameplay.
- analisis abstract: the level 1st look good at graphical criteria but a little dinamic in gameplay, it turns simple, slow, with a long tutorial that delays action, it needs "juicy" and be depth in fight parallel aspects, now looks like a prototype / model. The 2nd level is so confuse, it feels so slow, not dinamyc, almost nothing entertainment, the mini games are software structured but not good designed in gameplay. The 3rd level just now need a boss with better AI, challenging, dinamyc.
